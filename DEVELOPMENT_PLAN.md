# Development Plan for postMessage DevTools

## Current Status

The basic structure of the extension has been created with the following components:

- Manifest file configured for Chrome Extension with DevTools panel (using Manifest V3)
- Basic HTML/CSS for the DevTools panel UI
- Background service worker for handling communication
- Content script for capturing postMessage events
- Panel script for displaying events in the UI
- Basic icons and documentation

## Tasks Completed

- [x] Project structure and files setup
- [x] Extension manifest configuration
- [x] DevTools panel implementation
- [x] Communication between content script, background, and panel
- [x] Basic UI for displaying postMessage events
- [x] README and setup documentation
- [x] Placeholder icons
- [x] Migration to Manifest V3

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Testing the Basic Functionality**
   - Test the extension on simple pages with postMessage
   - Verify message capturing and display

2. **Refine Message Capturing**
   - Improve how postMessage data is captured and formatted
   - Add support for complex data types
   - Ensure all postMessage events are captured properly

3. **Enhance UI Features**
   - Implement the filter functionality
   - Add expand/collapse for message data
   - Add copy to clipboard functionality

4. **Add Message Search**
   - Implement search within captured messages
   - Add highlighting for search matches

## Medium-term Goals

1. **Message Organization**
   - Group messages by origin/domain
   - Add sorting options (time, origin, etc.)
   - Implement message categories/tags

2. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Filter by origin
   - Filter by data content
   - Save/load filter presets

3. **Message Analysis**
   - Add basic analysis of postMessage usage patterns
   - Detect potential security issues (missing origin checks, etc.)
   - Provide suggestions for secure postMessage usage

4. **Export/Import**
   - Export message history as JSON
   - Import message logs for analysis
   - Integration with browser's network/console logs

## Long-term Vision

1. **Cross-Browser Support**
   - Adapt for Firefox WebExtensions
   - Support for Safari Web Extensions

2. **Visual Message Flow**
   - Visualize postMessage communication between frames
   - Create a graph of message flows between origins

3. **Integration with Other DevTools**
   - Synchronize with console/network timelines
   - Add links to source code where postMessage is called

4. **Security Analysis**
   - Deep scanning for potential postMessage vulnerabilities
   - Integration with security tools/scanners
   - Automated security recommendations

## Technical Debt / Improvements

1. **Code Organization**
   - Consider using TypeScript for better type safety
   - Implement a proper build system (webpack, etc.)
   - Add unit tests

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize message storage for large numbers of events
   - Implement virtualized scrolling for large message logs
   - Add indexing for faster search/filter

3. **Documentation**
   - Add JSDoc comments to all functions
   - Create developer documentation
   - Add inline help/tooltips for users

## Testing Plan

1. Create test pages with various postMessage scenarios
2. Test across different Chrome versions
3. Test with complex messaging patterns (nested iframes, etc.)
4. Performance testing with high-volume postMessage traffic
5. User testing for UI/UX feedback
