# DevTools Panel UI Guidelines

You are working on the panel UI for the postMessage DevTools extension. This panel displays captured postMessage events in a format similar to the Chrome DevTools Console.

## Panel Components

The panel UI consists of:
- A toolbar with controls for clearing, filtering, and preserving messages
- A message list that displays captured postMessage events
- Message items with source information, origin, and formatted data
- JSON data formatting with syntax highlighting and collapsible sections

## UI/UX Guidelines

1. **DevTools Integration**: The panel should visually match Chrome DevTools styling
2. **Performance**: Render messages efficiently, especially with large datasets
3. **Usability**: Provide intuitive controls for message filtering and management
4. **Responsiveness**: Handle window resizing gracefully
5. **Dark/Light Mode**: Support both color schemes

## Key Functionality

- Message filtering by origin, source, and content
- JSON data collapsing/expanding
- Clear message log functionality
- Preserve log toggle when navigating between pages
- Syntax highlighting for message data

## Best Practices

- Use efficient DOM manipulation to avoid performance issues
- Implement virtualized scrolling for large message lists
- Handle error states gracefully
- Provide visual feedback for user actions
