# Content Script Guidelines

You are working on the content script for the postMessage DevTools extension. This script runs in the context of web pages and is responsible for intercepting postMessage events.

## Responsibilities

The content script:
- Overrides the native `window.postMessage` method
- Intercepts calls to `window.addEventListener` for message events
- Captures postMessage events as they occur
- Sends captured events to the background service worker
- Maintains a message queue if the background is disconnected

## Method Overriding Approach

Care must be taken when overriding native browser methods:
- Preserve original functionality exactly
- Ensure no side effects or performance issues
- Handle all edge cases (e.g., different parameter formats)
- Avoid interfering with page functionality

## Communication with Background

- Establish a connection with the background service worker
- Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Queue messages when connection is unavailable
- Send queued messages when connection is restored

## Performance Considerations

- Minimize overhead in message event processing
- Use efficient serialization for complex message data
- Avoid memory leaks in event listeners
- Execute overrides as early as possible (document_start)

## Security Concerns

- Do not expose extension functionality to the page
- Ensure injected code doesn't interfere with page security
- Respect Same-Origin Policy when handling messages
- Sanitize data before sending to background
