## üîß Installation

### From Chrome Web Store (Coming Soon)

The extension will be available in the Chrome Web Store soon.

### From Source (Development)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/oferlmntr/post-message-devtool.git
   ```

2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`

3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top-right corner

4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension

5. The extension is now installed! Open DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Opt+I on Mac) and look for the "postMessage" tab

## üìñ Usage

1. Open Chrome DevTools on any webpage (F12 or Cmd+Opt+I on Mac)
2. Navigate to the "postMessage" tab
3. As postMessage events occur on the page, they will appear in the panel
4. Use the controls at the top to:
   - Clear the current messages
   - Toggle "Preserve log" to keep messages when navigating
   - Open the filter panel to find specific content

## üìö How It Works

The extension injects a content script that captures all postMessage events on the page. These events are sent to the background service worker, which maintains a history of messages and communicates with the DevTools panel when it's open.

## üß© Use Cases

- **Debugging Cross-Origin Communication**: Easily view messages sent between frames or windows
- **Front-end Development**: Understand message flow in complex applications
- **Security Testing**: Analyze postMessage usage for potential vulnerabilities
- **API Debugging**: Inspect data passed through postMessage interfaces
- **Framework Development**: Debug messaging systems built on top of postMessage
